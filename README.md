# CPP-Project-CRM-System
Summer course project (2023)


The file CodeOne.cpp contains all the functionalities of the project:tracking purchases, classsification of customers into tiers, admin features that allow an admin to offer discounts to high value customers to name a few.

The file CodeUpdated.cpp contains most of the featues on CodeOne but has been implemented with better and more efficient Object Oriented Concepts 

The file items.csv is a database of all products that can be bought and customerdata.csv acts as a database to track all purchases and to monitor customer activity.
